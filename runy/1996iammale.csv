Comments:,"Study Data: Current intercompany experience not available thus Improvement Scale G (See SOA Table Identities 908 and 909) applied to update the 1983 Basic Table (See SOA Table Identities 823 and 824) to 1996, the resulting table was graduated to form a 1996 Basic Table (See SOA Tables 1696 and 1697) and then a 10% loading was subtracted. The method was suggested to quickly derive an updated table whose antecedents were known and which reasonably reflects annuitant mortality improvement from 1983 to 1996. Methodology: A set of 1996 basic (unloaded) tables was constructed by applying Scale G improvement rates to the 1983 Basic Tables; then a Jenkins osculatory graduation formula and a cubic curve at the high ages were used to obtain the 1996 Basic Tables. A 10% loading was deducted and the tables re-graduated to produce the final values. The new table could be referred to, if necessary, as a modification of the 1983 Table a (See SOA Table Identities 829 and 830). Data Transcription Errors: None. Data Certified: 04/2013"
